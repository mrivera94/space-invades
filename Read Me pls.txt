This is a simple recreation of the Space invaders game using Javascript.
The Purpose of this is to show that Javascript can be used to create 
something fun!

controls:
right arrow > moves right
left arrow > moves right
space bar > shoots cannon

current bugs:
Enemies can accidently shoot and kill themselves and eachother :(
